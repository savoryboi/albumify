# ALBUMIFY - A Spotify API application

## OVERVIEW
This front-end application uses Spotify's Web API to analyze user's top 100 tracks from 3 different time frames to determine the albums that a user has been listening to the most. I was inspired to make this application after receiving my Spotify Wrapped 2022, and wondering why albums were not a part of it. Albumify looks through the array of top tracks, and finds those that are on the same album. It then ensures that the 'album type' is an ALBUM (as opposed to a Single), determines the number of tracks from an album that are in the array, and sorts them in descending order. 
```
IMPORTANT: Currently, Albumify requires users to manually be given access to the application via the Spotify Developer Dashboard. If you would like access, please DM on twitter @savorycode.
